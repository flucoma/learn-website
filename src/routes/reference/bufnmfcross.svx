BufNMFCross uses non-negative matrix factorisation ("NMF", for more info, see [BufNMF](/reference/bufnmf)) to reconstruct the components of a ``target`` sound using spectral templates of a ``source`` sound. This process is a type of audio mosaiking (or "musaiking") that is intended to convey certain aspects of a target recording (such as melody and rhythm) using sound components (such as timbre) from a source recording. The result is a hybrid sound whose character depends on how well the target can be represented by the source's spectral templates. 

### Target: Drum Loop

<Audio
src="/reference/bufnmfcross/target.mp3"
label="Drum loop used as a target."
waveform={true}

### Source: Synthesizer sounds

### Output:

Rather than replacing single spectral frames in the target with single spectral frames in the source, BufNMFCross looks for opportunities to use a sequence of spectral frames from the source buffer to enhance the perception of the timbral morphology of both the source and target. This functionality can be adjusted using the ``continuity`` argument.

Additionally, BufNMFCross will avoid repeating a spectral frame within a specified duration of time (using the argument ``timeSparsity``). This helps avoid a common problem with this type of audio mosaiking: the repetition or overuse of a single sound element from the source. Avoiding recently used sounds is similar to a [round-robin](https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000267664-How-to-create-Round-Robin-sample-playback) functionality in many modern samplers.

Finally, BufNMFCross allows for a spectral frame in the ``target`` to be approximated using more than one spectral frame from the ``source``. This can help more closely approximate the spectral frames in the target, however, using too many ``source`` spectral frames at once can cause phase cancellation or other undesirable artefacts. This functionality can be adjusted using the ``polyphony`` argument, which sets the maximum number of ``source`` spectral frames that can be used at one time.

<IndentNote type="pointer">

For each spectral frame in the ``target``, every spectral frame of ``source`` is considered as a spectral template to possibly replace it. Because of this thorough checking, longer ``source`` buffers will take dramatically longer to process. For example, doubling the size of the source will quadruple the processing time.
